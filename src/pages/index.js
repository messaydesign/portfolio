  <p>
  It is all about solving problems, if not it would be pixel art. Product design always starts with understanding the problem rigorously.The fun part being a product designer is that I have problems to solve every single day with collaborative problem-solving process. In my 7+ years journey I realize that close collaboration of multidisciplinary team with a design process creates a winning product. 
Each individual from different disciplinary provides a unique and valuable perspective about the problem, as product enhances and feature updates have a huge impact across internal and external products.   In my product design process, I‚Äôll be focusing on four areas I believe will facilitate my ability to make meaningful contributions to the team I am working with.

          <p>
            Products are used by whole range of people, from different cultures, with physical, and situational
            constraints. User research will enable us to observe users in their natural environment, giving us a
            better understanding of the way users work.

          Developing a deeper understanding of the business mission, its culture, and operations to get a
        clear understanding of where the company is heading to and what type of product is aspired to
        build.

          <p>
          For every design decision creating a quick sketch, flowcharts, prototypes and detailed documentation
        will help to have a clear understanding throughout the team I am working with, this will
        clear the air between Product, Business and Engineering.

          <p>
          To pitch any design decision from any product team needs a clear pitch deck to get buy from
        stakeholders. In this process having a working prototype really help to avoid communication
        pitfalls and make positive impact.
